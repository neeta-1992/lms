## TIN/FEIN
TIN/FEIN, Taxpayer Identification Number, is an identification number used by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). A TIN can be a Social Security Number (SSN) or Employer Identification Number (EIN).

## Insured Name
The official name of the person or entity that owns a business. If the Insured is the only owner of your business with no d/b/a, then its legal name is simply your full name. For limited partnerships, LLCs, and corporations, the legal name of the business is the name registered with the state filing office.

## Agency State Residence
Agency State Residence State resident is the state that an agency hold its primary insurance license principal place of business

## Non-Resident License
An agent or an agency that is licensed in a state in which he or she don'ot reside.

## Domicile State
The state in which your Entity is registered, the place where your Entity principal affairs of business is maintained.

## DL/ID Issuance State
The state in which your Identification Card (ID Card) or Drivers license (DL) was issued.

## d/b/a
The Insured company operating name, doing business as, as opposed to the legal name of the company. A company is said to be doing business as when the name under which they operate their business differs from its legal, registered name.

## Inception Date
The date an insurance policy coverage is started. Also called effective date.


## Auditable
Auditable insurance policies means the premium listed on the quote/policy is estimated and won't be finalized until an audit is performed at the end of the term by the carrier. If you are not sure ask your underwriter.

## Short Rate
A penalty method of calculating the return premium often used when the policy is canceled at the insured's request. It uses a table of factors that results in penalties that can be lower or higher than short rate (90% pro rata) depending upon the date of cancellation.

## Policy Term
The period of time that an insurance policy provides coverage. Most policies have a one-year term (365 days) but many other policies also have a 6-month term. Policy terms can be for any length of time and can be for a short period when the period of risk is also short. Policy terms can also be for a multi-year period.

## AutoPay
AutoPay is a service that automatically deducts payments from insured's credit card or checking account to pay the monthly installments.

## Account Current
he means by which an agent settles his accounts with the insurance company each month, based upon a statement that includes all debits and credits. Account current allows agents and insureds to pay the net due, or request a check if the net is a credit (money owed the insured). Balances due are usually due at the end of the month following the month in which the business was written.

## Accounts Receivable
In premium finance, accounts receivable is an asset account comprised of the total of debit balances owed the premium finance company, whether current or not.

## Actuarial Earning
Actuarial earning is a means of earning interest on a financed contract. It is much more complicated than the Rule of 78 and requires sophisticated software to do it properly. In the premium finance context, it requires that interest be determined on a daily rate basis, much like a mortgage, then earned on the day that the next installment is paid.

## Add-on Rate
n finance, it is a means to determine the appropriate finance charge for a given amount financed over a given term using rate tables. If the rate is known and the term is known, a table (Regulation Z, Volume 1) can be used to determine the dollar charge.

## Agency Bill
A type of billing system for insurance policies in which the policy is purchased from an independent or captive agent, after which the bill appears on the agent's Account Current. The agent then contacts the insured and either collects the premium in cash or obtains a down payment and a signed premium finance agreement. The policy is subsequently paid on the following month's Agent Statement.

## Agent
An individual appointed by an insurance company who receives a commission on the policies sold and serviced. Based upon compensation, agents work for insurance companies in one of two classifications.. Captive Agents or Independent Agent

## Independent Agents
Independent agents represents at lease one insurance company and (at least in theory) services clients by searching the market for the most advantageous price for the most coverage. The agent's commission is a percentage of each premium paid.

## Captive Agents
Captive agents represent only one company and sells only its policies. This agent is paid on a commission basis in much the same manner as the independent agent.

## Effective Date
The date shown on the policy or binder when insurance coverage begins. This is also the date that interest begins to earn under the premium finance agreement, regardless of when funds are actually disbursed to the insurance company.

## Aging
Or "Aging Report", in premium finance, a report that separates all contracts in a portfolio of receivables into those that are "current", "30 days past due", "31-60 days past due", "61 to 90 days past due", "91 to 120 days past due", "121 to 150 days past due" and "151 to 180 days past due". Many states require any balance 181 days or more past due to be marked-off. The report is used to determine the effectiveness of the company's collection efforts.

## Amount Financed
In premium finance, the amount to be advanced by the premium finance company to the insurance company after the down payment has been deducted from the total premium.

## Annual Percentage Rate (APR)
The cost of credit as computed as a percentage at a yearly rate. The APR can be used to compare the costs of different kinds of credit since it reduces interest rates to a common yearly rate, regardless of term.

## Broker
Insurance salesperson who searches the marketplace in the interest of clients, not insurance companies. Not appointed by an insurance company and thus cannot bind coverage. Brokers are compensated through fees charged to the policyholder.

## Broker-Agent
Independent insurance salesperson who represents particular insurers but may also function as a broker by searching the entire insurance market to place an applicant's coverage to maximize protection and minimize cost. This person is licensed as an agent and broker by different companies (but not the same company).

## Cancellation
The process of terminating coverage under a policy of insurance. Cancellation may be requested by the insurer (in certain circumstances), the insured or by a lender for non-payment of premium if the policy is premium financed. See pro-rata and short rate for determination of earned and unearned premium.

## Disclosure Statement
The section of the premium finance agreement which illustrates the total premium, fees, amount financed, finance charge, annual percentage rate, total of payments and amount of each payment. Federal regulations require minimum type face size, bold letters and boxes to highlight this area for personal lines contracts only.

## Down Payment
That portion of a policy collected by the agent to bind coverage and create a premium finance agreement. An adequate down payment will collect sufficient premium to cover the earned portion from inception date to the first payment due date plus enough time to cancel the policy.

## Earned Premium
That portion of a premium for which the policy protection has already been given during the now-expired portion of the policy term. Premium is earned on a daily basis, usually on a 12-month term except for automobile coverage which is typically written for a 6-month term.

## Finance Charge
In premium finance, the amount charged by the premium finance company for advancing the amount financed to the insurance company on behalf of the insured.

## Flat Cancellation
Cancellation of an insurance policy as of the effective date without charge. Commonly used to refer to rescinded premium finance agreements as well.

## General Agent (GA)
The line between an agent and a General Agent is becoming more blurred, but a General Agent usually "holds the pen" for an insurance company, meaning the GA has underwriting and policy-writing authority. After that, the agency may or may not collect premiums, service the policy or settle claims.

## Insurance Policy
The contract between insurer and insured containing information regarding the risk, policy holder, contractual conditions and rate assessed.

## Late Charge
Also known as a Late Fee, it is an amount payable to the premium finance company, permitted by state statute, for any installment received more than 5 or 10 days after the due date (state statutes vary). Personal lines fees are usually limited to some nominal amount such as $5.00. Commercial lines usually consist of 5% of the installment amount. Late fees are posted as debits to the balance due from insured but are not earned as income until paid.

## Late Notice
Usually the same notice as the Notice of Intent to Cancel, but can be a separate notice encouraging the policyholder to bring his premium finance agreement current. See Notice of Intent to Cancel.

## Lender
A financial institution that loans money such as a bank, premium finance company or insurance company.

## Loan
A sum of money which is lent for a specific period of time, repayable with interest and fees.

## Net Premium
Is the portion of the premium for which the insurance company is responsible. It does not include the part of the premium that covers expenses, contingencies (commissions paid to agents) or profits. Why not profit? Because net premium is only potential profit at this point. The insurance company does not yet know whether or not it will be paid with this money.

## Net Premiums Earned
This item represents the adjustment of the net premiums written for the increase or decrease during the year of the liability of the company for unearned premiums. When an insurance company's business is increasing in amount from year to year, the earned premiums will usually be less than the written premiums. With the increased volume, the premiums are considered fully paid at the inception of the policy so that at the end of a calendar period, the company must set up premiums representing the unexpired terms of the policies. On a decreasing volume, the reverse is true.

## Notice of Cancellation
A legal notice advising the policyholder that coverage is cancelled as of a certain date. It must be preceded by a Notice of Intent to Cancel for the cancellation to be legal. It can be sent by the insurance company for underwriting reasons. It can be sent by a premium finance company only for non-payment.

## Notice of Intent to Cancel
A legal notice sent by a premium finance company (or insurance company) alerting the policyholder that the coverage will cease in ten to thirteen days (some states requires ten days plus mailing). Commonly called a "Late Notice" because most premium finance companies will wait for five or ten days (depending on state statutes) after the payment due date in order to charge a late fee.

## Notice of Reinstatement
A form used when an insurance policy has been cancelled for non-payment by a premium finance company then brought current by the policyholder. This notice advises the policyholder that a request has been sent to the insurance company to reinstate the insurance policy. Only the insurance company can reinstate a cancelled insurance policy. The premium finance company cannot do so.

## Premium
Is the cost of insurance coverage assessed by the insurer to the insured for coverage for a specified period. Also, the payment or one of the regular periodical payments a policyholder is required to make for an insurance policy.

## Premium Finance Agreement
The contract that establishes the relationship between an insured (the purchaser), the agent intermediary) and the insurance company (insurer). It pledges the unearned portion of the insurance policy to secure the money advanced by the premium finance company on behalf of the purchaser, and grants a limited power of attorney to the premium finance company to cancel the policy in the event of non-payment of premium.

## Premium Finance
A process wherein a lender pays an insurance premium to an insurer on behalf of an insured.  The policyholder repays the lender for the amount of the loan (amount financed) plus interest and any assessable fees and charges. The process is initiated at the agent/broker’s office when the coverage is originally applied for and the down payment is made.

## Production
In premium finance, the total of the amount financed of all contracts for a given time period.  Due to the short-term nature of premium finance agreements (6 to 12 months), production is not equal to accounts receivable.  Because of the rapid pay-down of the agreements, production is typically three times receivables; the converse ratio is that accounts receivable are equal to one-third of production. See Accounts Receivable

## Pro-Rata
A means of determining what portion of a policy has been earned (or unearned), usually for the purpose of cancellation or computation of endorsements.  Pro-rata is determined by dividing the number of days the policy was in effect by the number of days in the policy period (typically 365 days).  Thus a $1,000 policy in effect for 163 days would have earned 163/365 (44.6%) or $446. The insured would receive the reciprocal of that number, 55.4%, or $554 as unearned premium. Pro rata is normally used when the insurance company has cancelled the policy, or, in some states, when the premium finance company has cancelled the policy for non-payment.  These calculations are simplified by the use of a circular slide rule called the Ronoco Six and Twelve Calculator (copyright 1970) or software written for this purpose. See Earned Premium and Unearned Premium.

## Profit
A measure of the competence and ability of management to provide viable insurance products at competitive prices and maintain a financially strong company for both policyholders and stockholders. Virtually the same definition for premium finance except that the product is money and the revenue stream is made up of earned finance charges and fees

## PUC Filings
Applies to all motor carrier mandatory filings to obtain or maintain a PUC certificates or permits.

## Regulation Z, Volume 1
Published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, this publication consists of Annual Percentage Rate Tables. Any finance charge can be converted to an add-on rate by dividing the finance charge by the amount financed. The add-on rate can then be converted to an APR by simply finding the number of installments on the left and reading across until the add-on rate is found. (Add-on rates that fall between published rates are easily interpolated.) The APR is then read at the top of the column.

## Rule of 78
The "Rule of 78", also known as the "Sum of the Digits" method of earning interest and apportioning it according to how much of the balance due remains unpaid. 78 is the sum of the digits 1 through 12. As an example, interest on a 12-month loan would be apportioned as follows: in Month One, 12/78 or .1538 of the finance charge becomes earned interest and is taken into income. In Month Two, 11/78 or .1410 of the finance charge becomes earned interest and is taken into income. In Month Three, 10/78 or .1282, and so forth. In the premium finance context, most contracts are written on a 9-month basis, so this becomes the "Rule of 45" if you will.

## Short Rate
Is a means of determining what portion of a policy has been earned (or unearned), usually for the purpose of cancellation or computation of endorsements. There are several ways of determining a short rate calculation, but typically is determined by dividing the number of days the policy was in effect by the number of days in the policy period (typically 365 days) and adding an additional 10% penalty. Thus a $1,000 policy in effect for 163 days would have earned 163/365 (44.6% plus 10% = 54.6%) or $546. The insured would receive the reciprocal of that number, 45.4%, or $454. Short rate is normally used when the insured has cancelled the policy, or in many states, when the premium finance company has cancelled the policy for non-payment. Many states construe cancellation for non-payment a voluntary cancellation by the insured and thus eligible for short rate.

## Total of Payments
In premium finance, the total amount payable to the premium finance company by the insured. It consists of the amount financed plus the finance charge.

## Total Premium
In premium finance, the total amount of all policies financed on one premium finance agreement.

## Unearned Premium
For an individual policy, that portion of the premium not yet earned by the insurance company. If cancelled, that part of the premium that would be returned to the insured. The unearned portion can be computed on a pro-rata or short-rate basis. See Pro-Rata and Short-Rate.
