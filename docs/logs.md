<h1>Logs</h1>

**Logs** are automatically generated as a result of transactions made in LMS, such as changing Insured contact information, Recording a payment, Adding/Deleting/Changing a Policy, Attaching Docuemnts, etc..

The **Logs** provide historical visibility into activity, so changes won't go overlooked.

For these reasons, the **Logs** can not be Deleted and can be Viewed regardless of where the Users are in the system.
